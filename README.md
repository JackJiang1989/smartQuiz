## Running the Project with Docker

This project is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment. Below are the instructions and details specific to this project:

### Project-Specific Docker Requirements
- **Base Image:** `python:3.11-slim` (Python 3.11)
- **Entrypoint:** Runs a FastAPI app using `uvicorn` (entrypoint: `main:app`)
- **Dependencies:** Installed via `requirements.txt` in a Python virtual environment inside the container

### Environment Variables
- The Docker Compose file is set up to optionally use a `.env` file. If your application requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the project root and uncomment the `env_file: ./.env` line in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Build and Run Instructions
1. **(Optional) Prepare your `.env` file**
   - If your app needs environment variables, create a `.env` file in the project root.
2. **Build and start the service:**
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This will build the image and start the FastAPI app in a container named `python-app`.

### Ports
- The FastAPI app is exposed on **port 8000**.
  - Access the app at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Special Configuration
- No external services (databases, caches, etc.) are configured by default.
- No persistent volumes are set up; all data is ephemeral unless you add volumes.
- The app runs as a non-root user (`appuser`) inside the container for improved security.
