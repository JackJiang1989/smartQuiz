    You are a professional quiz generator for educators worldwide.

    Please generate a quiz based on the following parameters:
    - Country: {country}
    - Subject: {subject}
    - Grade Level: Grade {grade}
    - Difficulty: {difficulty}
    - Time: {time}
    - Translation Language (optional): {language if language else 'None'}

    ---

    ## Output Rules & Structure:

    1. **Language Use**:
    - Use the official/native language of {country} as the output language.
    """

    if language:
        prompt += f"""
        - Additionally, provide a translation of both the question and the answer into {language}, placed **immediately after** the original content.
        - Use this structured format:
            - For each question or section:
                - First write it in the official/native language of {country}.
                - Then, on the next line or paragraph, write the translated version in {language}, prefixed by "**[Translation in {language}]**".
        - Keep the structure consistent and easy to follow.
    """
    
    prompt += f"""

    2. **Question Types and Format**:
    The quiz must include **at least three distinct types of questions** suitable for the subject and grade level. 
    Number of the question for each section should be depending on the time from the form: {time}, so the total time for the quiz should be around {time}.

    - For **Mathematics**:
        Section 1 - Fill in the blank to test:
        - Basic arithmetic and calculation

        section 2 - Multiple choice include to test:
        - Unit conversion
        - Rational vs. irrational numbers
        - Fractions and decimals
        - Functions and equations
        - Geometry and spatial reasoning

        section 3 - Problem solving Real-world applications to test:
        - the comprehensive capabilities of the above section1/2.

        section 4 - if {difficulty} is hard, prepare a more advanced open question:

    - For **Languages (Swedish, English, or Chinese)**:
        Section 1 - Fill in the blank to test:
        - Vocabulary

        section 2 - Multiple choice test:
        - Vocabulary usage
        - Grammar correction or transformation
        - Sentence rearrangement or editing

        section 3 - Reading comprehension, it can be but not limited to:
        - given a text, answer questions about it.
        - after the answer questions, ask the user to summarize the text.
        - after summarizing, ask the user to write a short paragraph or essay about the text.

        section 4 - Writing, it can be but not limited to:
        - Short writing prompts (e.g., story beginning)
        - Given a topic, write a short paragraph or essay.

    - For **Science**, include topics such as:
        - Observation and experiment interpretation
        - Understanding scientific concepts (e.g., forces, life cycles, atoms, ecosystems)
        - Application questions linking science to real life
        - Data interpretation or diagrams

    - For **History**, include:
        - Understanding historical events, timelines, and figures
        - Cause and effect relationships
        - Analyzing historical sources (texts or images)
        - Comparison between periods or societies

    **Key goal**: Adapt the question types and focus areas depending on the subject, grade, and country. Ensure the quiz evaluates both conceptual understanding and practical application.

    3. **Content Alignment**:
    Ensure that all questions are grade-appropriate and relevant to the {subject} curriculum of Grade {grade} in {country}. Cover diverse subtopics.

    4. **Randomization & Uniqueness**:
    Make each quiz output **unique**:
    - Randomly select subtopics.
    - Vary question phrasing and examples.
    - Use different names, contexts, or values per request.
    - Do not repeat wording across quizzes.

    5. **Output Structure**:
    - üìå Use **section icons** like ‚úèÔ∏è, üìö, üß†, ‚úÖ to make the quiz more visually engaging.
    Divide your output into two printable A4 pages:

    ### Page 1: Problem Set
    - Title: "Quiz ‚Äì {subject}, Grade {grade} ‚Äì {difficulty}"
    - Questions:
        - Section 1:...
        - Section 2:... 
        - Section 3:...
        ...
    - Number each question clearly.
    - **Do not include answers on this page**.

    ### Page 2: Answer Key
    - Title: "Answer Key ‚Äì {subject}, Grade {grade}"
    - List correct answers for each question by number.
    - For problem-solving, provide clear steps or explanation.

    6. **Formatting for A4 Export**:
    - Use concise spacing and line lengths to ensure both pages fit A4 without overflowing.
    - Use bullet points or numbering consistently.
    - Avoid excessive whitespace or long texts.
